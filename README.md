# hayleyrodgers-professional-portfolio

Note: this was my first portfolio. It is outdated as I created a new one on the 30/9/22, which you can find [here](https://github.com/hayleyarodgers/portfolio). That said, I have chosen to keep this repository public because it represents an important milestone in my coding careerâ€”I am particularly proud of how I achieved this using *only* HTML and CSS after only a couple of weeks of learning to code.

## Description

My goal for this project was to create a personal portfolio to collate samples of my work. This is to showcase my skills and experience to prospective employers so they can determine whether I might be a good fit for their company.

To achieve this, I used HTML and CSS.

During this project, I consolidated my understanding of HTML and CSS. In particular, I re-inforced what I have learnt about:
- CSS variables
- The box model and flexbox
- Media queries
- Commenting on HTML and CSS
- Wireframes
- VS Code
- Terminal
- And, GitHub.
